# election_night2020

The election_night2020 repository will act as a place to store election night results as they arise, in addition to election context resources. Therefore, the two folders to share results are resources and context. The following are the descriptions: 


## Results

The results folder has results for each state, with state folders by state postal code. These can and should be updated with results in some type of csv/xls, etc. format as appropriate. 

## Context

The folders related to county and state level information that can be used on the fly for analyses of interest. They are grouped into the following folders: 

### acs_demos

### covid 

Information by county on new cases of COVID-19 over time. 

### maps
